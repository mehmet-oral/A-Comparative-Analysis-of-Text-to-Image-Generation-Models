# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Text-to-Image-Generation-Models
Comparative analysis of text-to-image GAN models (DF-GAN, AttnGAN, DM-GAN) with/without contrastive learning. Evaluated on MS-COCO using FID, VRAM usage, and inference time. DF-GAN excels in speed &amp; quality, while CL improves consistency. Code &amp; pretrained models included.
